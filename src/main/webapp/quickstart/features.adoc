= Optional features

Everything discussed in the quickstart guide so far is installed out-of-the-box in Apache ServiceMix, but we also have a lot of optional features that can be installed in the container when necessary.

== List of features
The list of features is available with the _features:list_ command.  The overview shows you whether or not the feature is currently installed, the version and the name of the feature.

The full list contains a lot of different features: optional Camel components, features for adding OBR or wrapper support to Serviceix, a web console, ...  Again, you can use things like _|_ and _grep_ to find the things in the list that you're interested in.

karaf@root> features:list | grep camel

== Example: Web console
To get the web console installed in ServiceMix, install the feature from your console
[source,text]
----
karaf@root> features:install webconsole
----

Afterwards, you can verify that the feature is marked installed in the overview.  You'll notice that the _webconsole-base_ feature has also been installed as a requirement for the _webconsole_ feature itself.

karaf@root> features:list | grep webconsole

You will now be able to point your browser to http://localhost:8181/system/console and login with user _smx_ and password _smx_ to access the web console.  From the webconsole, you can also start and stop bundles, install optional features again, ...
