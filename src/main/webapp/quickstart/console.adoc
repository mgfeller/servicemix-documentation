= Apache ServiceMix console

Now that we successfully installed and started Apache ServiceMix, we'll take a closer look at the console.  This is where you manage your ServiceMix instance, add and remove bundles, install optional features, ...

== Working with bundles

When ServiceMix is first started, a whole set of bundles providing the core features for the product are being installed.  Let's use the command console to find out more about them...

The _bundle:list_ command can be used to get a list of all bundles currently installed.  Enter this

{pygmentize:lang=text}
karaf@root> bundle:list
----

This is what the output looks like if you run this on your ServiceMix instance.

For every bundle, you see:
* the bundle id
* the bundle state
* if the bundle contains a Blueprint or Spring XML file, the next 2 columns will show you if the beans defined there were created successfully
* the bundle start level
* the bundle name and version

If you're looking for something specific in the list, you can use unix-like pipes and utilities to help you.  An example: to look for all Camel related bundles...

{pygmentize:lang=text}
karaf@root> bundle:list | grep camel

== Working with logging

Many of the applications you write will have some form of log output.  To look at the message in the log file, you can us the _log:diplay_ command.

{pygmentize:lang=text}
karaf@root> log:display
----

image::/quickstart/images/log-display.png[]

If you're only interested in the latest exception in the log file, you can use _log:display-exception_ instead.

{pygmentize:lang=text}
karaf@root> log:display-exception
----

image::/quickstart/images/log-display-exception.png[]

You can also change the log level at runtime by using the _log:set_ command.  You can try these commands on your instance now by first setting the log level to _DEBUG_ and then using _grep_ to make sure that you can actually see the extra logging.

{pygmentize:lang=text}
karaf@root> log:set DEBUG
karaf@root> log:display | grep DEBUG
----

image::/quickstart/images/log-set-debug.png[]

Afterwards, revert the log level to its original _INFO_ value again with _log:set_.

{pygmentize:lang=text}
karaf@root> log:set INFO
----

== ...and there's a lot more

These are obviously just a few examples of what the command shell is all about.  There are a lot more commands in the shell to help you deploy, monitor, manage and troubleshoot the applications you're building with ServiceMix.
